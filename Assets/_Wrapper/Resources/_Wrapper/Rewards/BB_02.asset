  title: Vacuum Chamber
  backText: "-Atom qubits need to be isolated. When atoms are left out in the open,
    other unwanted atoms bump into them. This destroys the quantum information.\n-Other
    atoms keep out ((not sure what this means)) \n-Vacuum chambers are made of glass
    and stainless steel. Special pumps remove everything from them, even the air.
    What's left? The perfect place to put an atom qubit."
