  title: Gate Simplification
  backText: '-There are different ways to make a circuit do the same thing to qubits

    -Example:
    If I wanted nothing to happen to my qubits, I could either have no gates or have
    2 not gates in a row

    -Doing things with the least amount of gates is what
    we call the simplest circuit

    -Simplifying circuits is similar to simplifying
    math equations 2+(1+4-4) can be simplified to 2+1.  '
  flavorText: 'Gate simplification is as easy as 1+7-(2*3), 2+4-4, 3*(4-3) '
