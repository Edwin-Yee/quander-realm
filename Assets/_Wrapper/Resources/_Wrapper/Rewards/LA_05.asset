  title: Maze
  backText: '-The two mazes traversed by the twins represent two different locations
    that the qubits might be in

    -The twins are entangled, similar to two qubits

    -Like
    the twins, entangled qubits affect one another, even if they are at different
    locations

    -Einstein is often quoted as saying entanglement allows for "Spooky
    action at a distance." Spooky or not, entanglement is part of what makes quantum
    computers useful. '
