  title: Quantum Circuit
  backText: '-A quantum circuit contains gates

    -Order matters! Just like in
    math operations, the gates need to be in a particular order to make sure the
    circuit does what you want it to do

    -The inputs of a quantum circuit are
    quantum bits (qubits)

    -At the end, or output of a quantum circuit, qubits
    are measured

    -Quantum circuits are like small programs that run on a quantum
    computer'
