  title: Fog
  backText: "-The fog hides information about where Wane has hid toys and quantum
    computer parts \n-Similarly, in quantum computing you cannot see the information
    stored in the qubits directly\n-In both the game and quantum computing, measurement
    reveals some information, but not all \n-Each time Bruce passes through the fog
    you get a litte more information on the buried treasures "
  flavorText: I dont have the foggiest idea where Wane's toys are
