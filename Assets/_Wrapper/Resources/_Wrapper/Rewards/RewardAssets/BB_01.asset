  title: Cryogenic Coolant
  backText: '-Heat is a real drag on quantum computers

    -Liquid helium is a few
    degrees above absolute zero temperature (which is really cold!), so it is a super
    cold coolant

    -A must have for some quantum computers: liquid helium flowing
    inside of a special fridge helps preserve the qubits

    -Fun fact: Liquid helium
    is a superfluid, which is a quantum phase of matter. Very cool. '
  flavorText: Beat the heat.
