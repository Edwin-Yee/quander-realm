  title: Probability
  backText: '-Probability let''s us make predictions. For example, if you flip a
    fair coin, there is a 50% or 1/2 probability it will land on heads and the same
    probability it end up on tails

    -The sum of the probability of all possible
    events is always 1

    -You can predict the likelihood of something happening
    with a quantum object, but can''t know for certain until you measure the object. '
