  title: Measured token
  backText: "-In the QueueBits game, a token represents a qubit (quantum bit)\n-When
    the token is fully colored in, that means the token has either a 100% chance
    to be that color, or the token was already measured and it will stay that color
    until the end of the game. \n-There is no need to guess about what color this
    token might turn into.\n-Probability is a big part of what makes quantum computers
    different than regular computers. "
  flavorText: This is certainly a token
