  title: Probabilistic Token
  backText: '-In the QueueBits game, a token represents a qubit (quantum bit)

    -When
    the token shows multiple colors that means the the token has a chance of being
    one color or the other. This is like superposition.

    -Depending on the level,
    you might reveal the final color when you place the token, or you might need
    to wait until the whole board is filled to find out. Place these tokens wisely!

    -This
    kind of uncertainty is a key part of how a qubit works. '
