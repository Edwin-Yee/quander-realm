  title: Entanglement
  backText: "-It's a relationship among quantum particles\n-Particles that are entangled
    do not have completely separate identities (properties). Measuring one object's
    properties affects the measurement outcome of the other \n-Occurs naturally but
    can be made in a lab\n-You need it for getting the most out of a quantum computer 
    \n-Entangled particles can be far apart or close together\n-You can't see it
    directly without fancy experiments"
